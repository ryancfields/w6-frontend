# Connecting the Frontend and the Backend

By the end of this lesson. You should be able to set up two separate servers that will speak with each other -- one with frontend code and the other with react code.

## Core Learning Objective

* Communicate with an application server using a front-end client

## Sub-Objectives

* Login a user via an external API and store a token in LocalStorage
* Logout a user locally
* Signup a user via an external API and store a token in LocalStorage
* Authorize routes on the frontend
* Populate information from an external API
* Delete records through an external API
* Create new records through an external API
* Update existing records through an external API

## Installation

1. Fork & clone this repository

1. `npm install`

1. `npm start`

## Instructions & Guiding Questions

- [ ] Start both your frontend server and your backend server. Then try copying the code below into the web console.
  ```js
  fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/users')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(console.log)
  ```

* **Question:** What error do you get? Why?

* **Your Answer:** 
CORS error - cross site origin which is saying I can't access other resources unless explicitialy allowed to.
---

- [ ] To get around this issue, we need to explicitly allow for requests to come from `localhost:3000`. To do so, we will use the [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) package. Install `cors` on the _backend server_ and whitelist `localhost:5000`.

* **Question:** Try your request again. What error do you get? Why?

* **Your Answer:**
401 Unauthorized from the auth.js middleware since I do not have token.
---

- [ ] In `App.js`, we have created our `loginUser()` method. Try invoking that function through the frontend, inspecting what is outputted.


Logging In User: {username: "Ryan", password: "Password"}

---

- [ ] We now want to try and login the user when they hit submit. Add the following to your `loginUser()` method:
  ```js
  fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/login', {
    body: JSON.stringify(user),
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    method: 'POST',
  }).then(res => res.json()).then(console.log)
  ```

* **Question:** Why do we need to include the "Content-Type" in the headers?
To tell the server what content to expect and parse.
* **Your Answer:**

* **Question:** How could you convert this method to an `async` method?
 async loginUser (user) {
    
    const response = await fetch(

  const json = await response.json()
---

- [ ] Let's move our requests to a better place. Create a new file at `./src/api/auth.js`. Add the following inside of it:
  ```js
  const { NODE_ENV } = process.env
  const BASE_URL = NODE_ENV === 'development'
    ? 'http://localhost:5000'
    : 'tbd' // Once we deploy, we need to change this

  export const login = async (user) => {
    const response = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/api/login`, {
      body: JSON.stringify(user),
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      method: 'POST'
    })
    const json = await response.json()
    
    return json
  }
  ```

  Update `App.js` to use the `login()` function, logging out the response from it.

* **Question:** What is happening on the first couple of lines of the new file you've created?

* **Your Answer:** 
Setting parameters when we deploy, one as a default to run during testing?  Then the ability 
to specify another value.

---

- [ ] Let's store the token in LocalStorage with a key of `journal-app`.

* **Question:** Why are we storing the token?

* **Your Answer:**

We are storing the token to give a state to the app - since the app is stateless this allows us to know information about the user without requiring it to authenticate each time.
---

- [ ] We now have the token, but we don't have any of the user information. Add a new function to our `./src/api/auth.js` called `profile()` that sends over the token in order to retrieve the user information. Then, log that information.

* **Question:** Where did you write your code to manipulate LocalStorage? Why?

* **Your Answer:** 
Inside auth.js, but we could have placed in the React/Frontend side too.
---

- [ ] Now that we have the user's information, let's store the user's ID in state. Set `currentUserId` to the user ID you've retrieved.



* **Question:** What changes on the page after you successfully login? Why?

* **Your Answer:**

We now see create a new post

* **Question:** What happens if you enter in the incorrect information? What _should_ happen?

* **Your Answer:**

Crashes with an unhandedled Rejection.  It should handle a in a graceful manner.
---

- [ ] Try refreshing the page. You'll notice it _looks_ like you've been logged out, although your token is still stored in LocalStorage. To solve this, we will need to plug in to the component life cycle with `componentDidMount()`. Try adding the following code to `App.js`:
  ```js
  async componentDidMount () {
    //Check to see if a local token is present.
    const token = window.localStorage.getItem('journal-app')

    // If there is a local token, call auth profile and get the current user _id.

    if (token) {
      const profile = await auth.profile()
      try {
        //Finaly set the state of the current user ID to the one that is retrived by the token:
        this.setState({ currentUserId: profile.user._id })
      } catch (e) { }
    }
  }
  ```

* **Question:** Describe what is happening in the code above.

* **Your Answer:**

Added above.

---

- [ ] Now when you refresh the page, it looks as though you are logged in. Next, try clicking the logout button.

* **Question:** When you click "Logout", nothing happens unless you refresh the page. Why not?

* **Your Answer:**

We still have the token, which means we are not logged out if we have a token.
---

- [ ] Update the `logout()` method to appropriately logout the user.

* **Question:** What did you have to do to get the `logout()` function to work? Why?

* **Your Answer:**
Remove the token from the local storage side
Reset the User ID to null.
---






- [ ] Following the patterns we used above, build the Signup feature.

---

- [ ] When a user logs in or signs up, we should bring them to the `/users` route. Update both features so that the user is moved to that route after a successful login/signup.

---

- [ ] Try logging out and then go directly to the `/users` route.

* **Question:** What happens? What _should_ happen?

* **Answer:**
This is the users route, and we should redirect to this route.
---

- [ ] Try _replacing_ the `/users` Route in `App.js` with the following:
  ```jsx
  <Route path='/users' render={() => {
    return this.state.currentUserId ? <UsersContainer /> : <Redirect to='/login' />
  }} />
  ```

* **Question:** Describe what is happening in the code above.

* **Your Answer:**
Checking to see if there is a current userID, if no it redirects to login.  Else goes to users route.
---

- [ ] Now try logging in. Then, when you're on the `/users` page, refresh the page.

* **Question:** What happens and why?

* **Your Answer:**

---

- [ ] To solve this problem, let's add a `loading` key to our App's state, with the default value set to `true`. When `componentDidMount()` finishes, set the `loading` key to equal `false`. Using this key, solve the issue of refreshing on the `/users` page. Make sure everyting continues to work whether you are logged in or out.

* **Question:** What did you do to solve this problem?

* **Your Answer:**

---

- [ ] We will have the same problem on the `/users/<userId>/posts` page. Use the same strategy to have this page load correctly on refresh.

* **Question:** In what component did you add the `loading` property and why?

* **Your Answer:**

---

- [ ] Using the same principals as above, make it so that if the user is logged in, they cannot go to the `/login` or `/signup` routes. Instead, forward them to `/users`.

---

- [ ] Right now, the data inside of `users/Container.js` is static. Using `componentDidMount()`, update this code so that we pull our data from our API.

  _NOTE: You may want to create a new file in `./src/api/` to organize these requests.

---

- [ ] Let's get our "Delete" link working. On the backend, create a `DELETE Post` route with the path of: 
  ```
  DELETE /users/:userId/posts/:postId
  ```
  This request should only be able to be made if the user is logged in and it's the user's post.

---

- [ ] On the frontend, create a new function in your `src/api` folder that will delete a post. Use that function inside of the `src/components/posts/Container` file. Upon successful deletion, send the user back to the `/users/<userId>/posts` route.

---

- [ ] Try deleting a post using the link.

* **Question:** Why did the number of posts not change when you were redirected back to the `/users` route?

* **Your Answer:** Whenever we modify our data with a Create, Update, or Delete, we have a few options on how to make our frontend reflect those changes. What options can you think of?

* **Question:**

---

- [ ] Using your preferred method, update your code so that the frontend will reflect the changes made to the backend.

---

- [ ] Right now it looks like we can Edit and Delete posts for other users. Hide/display those actions to only be available on a post if it's the user's post.

---

- [ ] Let's get our "Create a New Post" form to work. On the backend, create a `CREATE Post` route with the path of:
  ```
  POST /users/:userId/posts
  ```
  This request should only be able to be made if the user is logged in and it's from the same user as the one specified in the route.

---

- [ ] On the frontend, build a function that will POST to the database. Connect that function to the `onSubmit` functionality for the creation form. Finally, use your preferred method to update the state of our frontend. Upon successful creation, send the user back to the `/users/<user-id>/posts` page.

---

- [ ] Our final step is to get our Update form to work. Follow the steps from above to finish this final feature.

## Exercise

We got a lot done but there's still a lot to do to make this app fully functional. Complete the following features on this application. 

- [ ] If there are no posts for a user, show a message on their `/users/<userId>/posts` page that encourages them to create a new post.

- [ ] If there is no emotion for a post, hide the associated message on each post.

- [ ] Show the user's username on the navigation when they are logged in as a link. When clicked, go to a new page: `/users/<userId>/edit`

- [ ] Create a page at `/users/<userId>/edit` that allows a user to update their `name`. On save, redirect them to their `/users/<userId>/posts` page.

- [ ] If the user has a name, show that on the Navigation, `/users` page, and `/users/<userId>/posts` page instead.

- [ ] On the login page, appropriately handle errors so that the user has a chance to correct their username/password combination. Display some kind of helpful message.

- [ ] On the signup page, appropriately handle errors so that the user has a chance to correct their username/password combination. Display some kind of helpful message.

- [ ] On the create post page, appropriately handle errors so that the user has a chance to correct their post. Display some kind of helpful message.

- [ ] On the update post page, appropriately handle errors so that the user has a chance to correct their post. Display some kind of helpful message.

- [ ] Create a new frontend route at `/users/<userId>/posts/<postId>` that shows a single post. Update your Create and Edit forms to redirect here instead of to the general `/posts` page.
